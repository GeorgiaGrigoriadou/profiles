With this project, I aim to create an internet platform that showcases the portfolios of all users stored in the database. Users will have the ability to input, edit, and delete their data. Additionally, they will be able to delete their portfolio entirely or create a new one. This platform will serve as a centralized hub for users to display their work, achievements, and professional profiles, providing them with a space to showcase their skills and accomplishments to a wider audience. Through intuitive user interfaces and seamless functionality, the platform will empower users to manage their portfolios efficiently while offering visitors a convenient and comprehensive way to explore diverse talents and projects.
